# A-Plus-B example

## Introduction

In this example, C++ side starts by setting 2 random numbers between 0 and 10 in shared memory. Then, Python side gets the
numbers and sets the sum of the numbers in shared memory (in another region). Finally, C++ gets the sum that Python set.
The procedure is analogous to C++ passing RL states to Python and Python passing RL actions back to C++, and is
repeated many times.

We created this example to demonstrate the basic usage of ns3-ai's two interfaces: Gym interface and message interface.

### Cmake targets

- `ns3ai_apb_gym`: A-Plus-B using Gym interface
- `ns3ai_apb_msg_stru`: A-Plus-B using message interface (struct-based)
- `ns3ai_apb_msg_vec`: A-Plus-B using message interface (vector-based)

### Running the example

This example can be run using the following interfaces:

#### Gym interface

1. [Setup ns3-ai](../../install.md)
2. Run Python script

```bash
cd contrib/ai/examples/a_plus_b/use_gym
python apb.py
```

#### Message interface (struct-based)

1. [Setup ns3-ai](../../install.md)
2. Run Python script

```bash
cd contrib/ai/examples/a_plus_b/use_msg_stru
python apb.py
```

#### Message interface (vector-based)

1. [Setup ns3-ai](../../install.md)
2. Run Python script

```bash
cd contrib/ai/examples/a_plus_b/use_msg_stru
python apb.py
```

### Output

For Gym interface and Message interface (struct-based), the terminal will 
repeatedly print two random numbers generated by C++ and their sum 
calculated by Python:

```text
set: 4,10;
get: 14;
set: 10,8;
get: 18;
set: 5,1;
get: 6;
set: 10,6;
get: 16;
......
```

For Message interface (vector-based), the terminal will repeatedly print 
a vector of two random numbers, with default size = 3, generated by C++, 
and the vector of the sums, also size=3, calculated by Python:

```text
set: 1,1;2,4;1,4;
get: 2;6;5;
set: 6,10;10,2;1,2;
get: 16;12;3;
set: 4,4;7,10;6,4;
get: 8;17;10;
set: 10,3;5,8;10,9;
get: 13;13;19;
......
```

## Quickstart on ns3-ai


### 2. Message interface (struct version)

Message interface is more low-level compared to Gym interface. In fact, interprocess communication of Gym interface is based on message interface. 
It has send and receive functions like a typical message queue. 

When there is existing `struct` or `std::vector` to be 
shared with Python, it's easier to apply message interface then Gym interface, because you don't need to convert the data to Gym spaces.
Also, both C++ and Python side can access the data directly, which save the serialization/deserialization time especially 
for sharing large amount of data or having frequent interaction.

With **struct** version of message interface, the scenario is the same with Gym interface: C++ 
sends two numbers to Python, and Python sends one sum to C++. 

With **vector** version, the scenario is different: C++ sends a vector of two numbers to Python, and Python sends a 
vector of sums to C++.

*Note: the interface may be enhanced in the future, such as inheriting from `ns3::Singleton` to avoid using local
variable, and adding attributes for easier configuration.*

#### C++ side

We have two structs for the two numbers, `env_a` and `env_b`, and their sum, `act_c`:

```c++
struct EnvStruct
{
    uint32_t env_a;
    uint32_t env_b;
}

struct ActStruct
{
    uint32_t act_c;
}
```

Start by declaring a `Ns3AiMsgInterface` (parameters will be explained later):

```c++
Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct> cpp_side(false, false, true);
``` 

Then, interact with Python (some initialization code is skipped). The interface is simple and intuitive. To set `temp_a` and `temp_b` 
into shared memory, just write them into `m_single_cpp2py_msg`. To get the sum, just read from `m_single_py2cpp_msg`.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ENV; ++i) {
    cpp_side.cpp_send_begin();
    std::cout << "set: ";
    uint32_t temp_a = distrib(gen);
    uint32_t temp_b = distrib(gen);
    std::cout << temp_a << "," << temp_b << ";";
    cpp_side.m_single_cpp2py_msg->env_a = temp_a;
    cpp_side.m_single_cpp2py_msg->env_b = temp_b;
    std::cout << "\n";
    cpp_side.cpp_send_end();

    cpp_side.cpp_recv_begin();
    std::cout << "get: ";
    std::cout << cpp_side.m_single_py2cpp_msg->act_c;
    std::cout << "\n";
    cpp_side.cpp_recv_end();
}
```

Note that before and after read or write, several **synchronization** functions are needed. `cpp_send_begin` and `cpp_send_end` 
are for sending to Python, and `cpp_recv_begin` and `cpp_recv_end` are for receiving from Python. There are similar 
functions for Python side. These functions are based on semaphore, which requires strict sequence. If C++ side is receiving 
at the beginning, then Python side must be sending at the beginning. 
[The OSTEP book](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-sema.pdf) has a good introduction of semaphores.

##### Parameters of `Ns3AiMsgInterface`

Function prototype:

```c++
Ns3AiMsgInterface(bool is_memory_creator,
                  bool use_vector,
                  bool handle_finish,
                  uint32_t size = 4096,
                  const char* segment_name = "My Seg",
                  const char* cpp2py_msg_name = "My Cpp to Python Msg",
                  const char* py2cpp_msg_name = "My Python to Cpp Msg",
                  const char* lockable_name = "My Lockable");
```

- `is_memory_creator`: Controls whether this side initializes the interface. Because the shared memory is a named region, 
after the creator initializes the segment with a unique name, the other side can access the segment with that name.
- `use_vector`: Controls whether to use `std::vector` or not. 
  - If `true`, the vectors (`m_cpp2py_msg` and `m_py2cpp_msg`) must be initialized (resize to required length) before 
  use. See the Python side of vector version of this example for details.
  - If `false`, use the structs (`m_single_cpp2py_msg` and `m_single_py2cpp_msg`) for data exchange, and no initialization is required.
- `handle_finish`: Enables a simple protocol, which notifies Python side when C++ side interface is destroyed (possibly 
due to ns-3 program exit). This is useful for all applications using the message interface, because Python side is
always unaware of simulation ending. For Gym interface on top of msg interface, this function should not be enabled 
because Gym interface has its own protocol dealing with simulation ending.
- `size`: Size of Boost's `managed_shared_memory`. The default value is enough for most applications.
- `segment_name`: Unique name of the shared memory segment.
- `cpp2py_msg_name`: Unique name of the C++ to Python message inside the memory segment.
- `py2cpp_msg_name`: Unique name of the Python to C++ message inside the memory segment.
- `lockable_name`: Unique name of the lockable (contains semaphores) inside the memory segment.

#### Python side

Python side interface is a **binding** of the C++ side interface. Python binding means the Python side reuses the C++
code to have the same capabilities as C++. Because the C++ code is template-based, Python binding varies with the data
structure that is being shared, and every example is unique.

The bindings in ns3-ai is created with pybind11. For detailed instructions on writing Python bindings, check out [pybind11 documentation](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). 
However, most bindings have similar style and fixed components. A Plus B's binding code is a good boilerplate, 
you can just modify a few lines and apply to another program.

Basically, you can follow these steps:

1. Declare the Python module to create. In this example, `ns3ai_apb_py_not_vec` will be the import name of the binding module.

```c++
PYBIND11_MODULE(ns3ai_apb_py_not_vec, m) {
    ...
}
```

2. Bind the structures. Every item that Python may access (not necessarily all items) need to be mentioned in the code.
The names in Python can be different from that in C++. For instance, `a` in Python is `env_a` in C++.

```c++
py::class_<EnvStruct>(m, "PyEnvStruct")
    .def(py::init<>())
    .def_readwrite("a", &EnvStruct::env_a)
    .def_readwrite("b", &EnvStruct::env_b);

py::class_<ActStruct>(m, "PyActStruct")
    .def(py::init<>())
    .def_readwrite("c", &ActStruct::act_c);
```

3. Bind the C++ class. Every function or member that Python may use (not necessarily all) need to be mentioned in the binding code. 
In this binding, C++-only methods such as `cpp_send_begin` is excluded because Python side never use it.

```c++
py::class_<ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>>(m, "Ns3AiMsgInterface")
    .def(py::init<bool, bool, bool, uint32_t, const char*, const char*, const char*, const char*>())
    .def("py_recv_begin", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::py_recv_begin)
    .def("py_recv_end", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::py_recv_end)
    .def("py_send_begin", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::py_send_begin)
    .def("py_send_end", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::py_send_end)
    .def("py_get_finished", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::py_get_finished)
    .def_readwrite("m_single_cpp2py_msg", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::m_single_cpp2py_msg)
    .def_readwrite("m_single_py2cpp_msg", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::m_single_py2cpp_msg)
    ;
```

The binding module is configure by CMake to generate shared library at the source directory. Therefore, the Python script
importing the binding must be also in the source directory.

Import the binding module and create message interface:

```python
import ns3ai_apb_py_not_vec as apb      # note: the code must be in the same directory with binding

rl = apb.Ns3AiMsgInterface(True, False, True, 4096, "My Seg", "My Cpp to Python Msg", "My Python to Cpp Msg", "My Lockable")
```

Interaction with C++:

```python
while True:
    rl.py_recv_begin()
    if rl.py_get_finished():
        break
    temp = rl.m_single_cpp2py_msg.a + rl.m_single_cpp2py_msg.b
    rl.py_recv_end()

    rl.py_send_begin()
    rl.m_single_py2cpp_msg.c = temp
    rl.py_send_end()
```

Remember to destroy the interface before exit:

```python
del rl
```

#### Running the example

1. [Setup ns3-ai](../../install.md)
2. Run Python script first

Python side should run first, because Python script is the shared memory creator.

```bash
cd contrib/ns3-ai/examples/a_plus_b/use_msg_stru
python apb.py
```
3. When you see the message `Created message interface, waiting for C++ side to send initial environment...`, open
   another terminal and run C++ side.

```bash
./ns3 run ns3ai_apb_msg_stru
```

#### Output

The output is same with Gym interface.

### 3. Message interface (vector version)

This vector version A Plus B example demonstrates how C++ sends a vector of two numbers to Python, and Python sends a
vector of sums to C++.

#### C++ side

Start by declaring a `Ns3AiMsgInterface`, with `use_vector` (second parameter) set to `true`:

```c++
Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct> cpp_side(false, true, true);
```

Then interact with Python. Instead of `m_single_cpp2py_msg` and `m_single_py2cpp_msg` in struct version of msg interface, 
in vector version `m_cpp2py_msg` and `m_py2cpp_msg` are used, which are both `std::vector`s. The code below assumes the 
vector's size is `APB_SIZE`, and writes random numbers to the whole vector in the inner `for` loop.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ENV; ++i) {
    cpp_side.cpp_send_begin();
    std::cout << "set: ";
    for (int j = 0; j < APB_SIZE; ++j) {
        uint32_t temp_a = distrib(gen);
        uint32_t temp_b = distrib(gen);
        std::cout << temp_a << "," << temp_b << ";";
        cpp_side.m_cpp2py_msg->at(j).env_a = temp_a;
        cpp_side.m_cpp2py_msg->at(j).env_b = temp_b;
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
    cpp_side.cpp_send_end();

    cpp_side.cpp_recv_begin();
    std::cout << "get: ";
    for (ActStruct j: *cpp_side.m_py2cpp_msg) {
        std::cout << j.act_c << ";";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
    cpp_side.cpp_recv_end();
}
```

The synchronization method of the vector version is the same as that of struct version.

#### Python side

Binding vector is different from binding structs, because essential methods such as `resize`, `__len__` and `__getitem__` needs 
to be implemented. The binding code is again a boilerplate and can be easily reused in other projects.

```c++
py::class_<ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Cpp2PyMsgVector>(m, "PyEnvVector")
    .def("resize", static_cast
         <void (ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Cpp2PyMsgVector::*)
              (ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Cpp2PyMsgVector::size_type)>
         (&ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Cpp2PyMsgVector::resize))
    .def("__len__", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Cpp2PyMsgVector::size)
    .def("__getitem__", [](ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Cpp2PyMsgVector&vec, uint32_t i) -> EnvStruct & {
        if (i >= vec.size()) {
            std::cerr << "Invalid index " << i << " for vector, whose size is " << vec.size() << std::endl;
            exit(1);
        }
        return vec.at(i);
    }, py::return_value_policy::reference)
    ;

py::class_<ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Py2CppMsgVector>(m, "PyActVector")
    .def("resize", static_cast
         <void (ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Py2CppMsgVector::*)
              (ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Py2CppMsgVector::size_type)>
         (&ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Py2CppMsgVector::resize))
    .def("__len__", &ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Py2CppMsgVector::size)
    .def("__getitem__", [](ns3::Ns3AiMsgInterface<EnvStruct, ActStruct>::Py2CppMsgVector&vec, uint32_t i) -> ActStruct & {
        if (i >= vec.size()) {
            std::cerr << "Invalid index " << i << " for vector, whose size is " << vec.size() << std::endl;
            exit(1);
        }
        return vec.at(i);
    }, py::return_value_policy::reference)
    ;
```

In this vector version example, the two vectors `m_cpp2py_msg` and `m_py2cpp_msg` are both initialized on Python side, 
using the `resize` method:

```python
import ns3ai_apb_py as apb
APB_SIZE = 3

rl = apb.Ns3AiMsgInterface(True, True, True, 4096, "My Seg", "My Cpp to Python Msg", "My Python to Cpp Msg", "My Lockable")
assert len(rl.m_py2cpp_msg) == 0
rl.m_py2cpp_msg.resize(APB_SIZE)
assert len(rl.m_cpp2py_msg) == 0
rl.m_cpp2py_msg.resize(APB_SIZE)
```

Interact with C++:

```python
while True:
    rl.py_recv_begin()
    rl.py_send_begin()
    if rl.py_get_finished():
        break
    for i in range(len(rl.m_cpp2py_msg)):
        rl.m_py2cpp_msg[i].c = rl.m_cpp2py_msg[i].a + rl.m_cpp2py_msg[i].b
    rl.py_recv_end()
    rl.py_send_end()
```

In the above code, `py_send_begin` is called before `py_recv_end`. This won't cause errors because C++ is not posting on 
the semaphore `m_py2cpp_empty_count` which `py_send_begin` is waiting until `py_send_end` completes.

#### Running the example

1. [Setup ns3-ai](../../install.md)
2. Run Python script first

Python side should run first, because Python script is the shared memory creator.

```bash
cd contrib/ns3-ai/examples/a_plus_b/use_msg_vec
python apb.py
```
3. When you see the message `Created message interface, waiting for C++ side to send initial environment...`, open
   another terminal and run C++ side.

```bash
./ns3 run ns3ai_apb_msg_vec
```

#### Output

The output is at C++ side, repeatedly printing vectors of two random numbers generated by C++ and their sum calculated 
by Python (default vector size is 3):

```text
set: 1,1;2,4;1,4;
get: 2;6;5;
set: 6,10;10,2;1,2;
get: 16;12;3;
set: 4,4;7,10;6,4;
get: 8;17;10;
set: 10,3;5,8;10,9;
get: 13;13;19;
......
```
